## 💻 Local Development

### Quick Overview

The project has two main parts:

```
know-India/
├── frontend/    # React app (port 3000)
└── backend/     # Express API (port 5000)
```

### Setup Steps

1. Install dependencies in both folders:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```

2. Set up your `.env` file in the backend folder (see README for details)

3. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd backend && npm start
   
   # Terminal 2
   cd frontend && npm start
   ```

> **Note:** You'll need Node.js 18+, MySQL, and API keys for full functionality. Check the [README](README.md) for complete setup instructions.

## ✍️ Commit Messages

We follow a simple commit message format. No need to stress about it — just try to be clear:

```
type: short description
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` — New feature
- `fix:` — Bug fix
- `docs:` — Documentation changes
- `style:` — Formatting, no code change
- `refactor:` — Code restructuring
- `test:` — Adding tests
- `chore:` — Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat: add share button to itinerary page
fix: resolve login redirect loop
docs: update contributing guidelines
style: format navbar component
```

Don't overthink it. A clear message is better than a perfect format.

## 🎨 Code Style

We don't enforce strict rules, but please try to:

- **Follow existing patterns** — Look at how similar code is written in the project
- **Use meaningful names** — `userProfile` is better than `up`

- **Format your code** — Use Prettier or your editor's formatter

### Frontend (React)
- Functional components with hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
